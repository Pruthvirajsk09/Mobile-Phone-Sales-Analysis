# Mobile-Phone-Sales-Analysis

🧩 Business Problem

A global mobile phone retailer operates across multiple countries and sales channels, including online, partner stores, and physical outlets. The company generates a large volume of sales data but lacks a centralized reporting system to monitor performance, identify best-selling products, and understand customer purchasing behavior.

Management needs an interactive dashboard to analyze sales performance, identify trends, and understand customer preferences to improve business strategy, marketing, and inventory planning.
